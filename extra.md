Chosen bonus feature(s): Hangman, darkmode

Explanation (~100 words): 
I have implemented hangman in channel. The game starts when a user input a message in the format '/guess [letter]'. The input will be checked in 3 conditions, correct and unchosen letter, incorrect and unchosen letter, and chosen letter. Each of which generates 3 different messages. For convenient interpretation considering there may be more than one user in the channel playing the game at the same time, the messages generated will be stored as the corresponding player's message. 

The other bonus feature is darkmode. In my implementation, the user is able to choose their desired color theme - light or dark, when they register or log in as a user, which is located at the top left corner of both pages. I personally really like the color choice of the dark theme!

Overall I have probably spent more than 20 hours in total to initially design and implement the two features.
